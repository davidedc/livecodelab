###
## Although LiveCodeLab is ultimately running Javascript code behind the scenes,
## the user uses a simpler syntax which is basically coffeescript with a
## little bit of extra sugar.
## CodeTransformer takes care of translating this simplified syntax to
## Javascript. Also note that CodeTransformer might return a program
## that substituted the program passed as input.
## This is because doOnce statements get transformed by pre-prending a
## tick once they are run, which prevents them from being run again.
