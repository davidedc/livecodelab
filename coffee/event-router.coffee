###
## EventRouter bridges most events in LiveCodeLab.
## Error message pops up? Event router steps in.
## Big cursor needs to shrink? It's the event router who stepped in.
## You get the picture.
## Any part of LiveCodeLab can just register callbacks and trigger events,
## using some descriptive strings as keys.
## Handy because it's a hub where one could attach debugging and listing
## of all registered callbacks. Probably not a good idea to attach
## rapid-fire events due to overheads.
