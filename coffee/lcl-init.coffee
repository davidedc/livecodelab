    # runtime and compile-time error management //////////
    #/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    # Two different types of errors are managed in
    # two slightly different ways.
    #
    # Compile-time errors are the errors such as an extra
    # comma being added, or an unbalanced parenthesis, or
    # in general any of the syntactic problems.
    # These errors are just reported and the
    # new borked program does *not* result in a new
    # draw Function, so the previous syntactically correct
    # program is kept as the draw Function. The editor
    # content is kept the same as the user is probably just
    # finishing to type something.
    # If the autocoder is active, the editor
    # undoes the change, which triggers in a recompilation.
    # So this undo/recompilation cycle results in eventually
    # a syntactically correct program being set as
    # the draw Function.
    #
    # Runtime errors are things such as calling a function
    # with invalid parameters, accessing a non-existing
    # field of an object, accessing a null or an undefined,
    # accessing a variable that is not defined anywhere.
    # Runtime errors cannot be caught at compile time (not in
    # general anyways) because they are syntactically correct
    # and doing analysis on runtime behaviour at compile time
    # is extremely difficult if not outright impossible.
    # For example one might want to try to figure out whether
    # all the called functions and all the referenced variables
    # actually exist. In practice though one might create
    # those variables at runtime depending on complex tests
    # on state of the system, so one cannot really figure out
    # at compile time whether all functions and variables will
    # actually be in place when the program runs. One could
    # carry out some clever checks in particular cases, but *in
    # general* it's an impossible thing to do.
    # So an "unstable" program might often pass the compile checks
    # and be turned into a new draw Function.
    # When the next frame runs (or at some point in one of the
    # next frames), the draw Function is run and
    # a runtime error is thrown. At this point what we just
    # want to do is to keep the editor contents the same (because
    # user might be just finishing to type something) and we
    # just swap the current draw Function with a previous draw
    # Function that seemed to be stable, so that the animation
    # in the background doesn't stop. Note again that there is no
    # guarantee that just because a function was stable in the
    # past that it might still be stable now. For example the old
    # stable function might do silly things in the new state
    # that has been changed/borked in the meantime.
    # Or just simply a stable Function might
    # eventually do some silly things on its own, for example
    # it might do an out-of bounds array reference as the frame
    # count is incremented. Since at the moment we keep
    # track of only one stable function at the time (rather than
    # a stack of the) in general one cannot guarantee
    # that the animation will keep going no matter what. It probably
    # will in most normal cases though.
    # When the autocoder is active, a runtime error *does not* swap
    # the current function for an old stable one. Doing so
    # causes some bad interactions with the undoing of the
    # editor. Rather, the editor "undoes" its content,
    # which causes old content to be recompiled, and this
    # undo/recompile cycle carries on until a
    # syntactically-correct version of the program can be
    # established as the draw Function. If this new version still
    # throws a runtime error, the editor "undoes" again, until a
    # program that is both syntactically correct and stable
    # is found.
