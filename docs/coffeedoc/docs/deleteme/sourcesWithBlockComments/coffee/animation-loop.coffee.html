        <p>The animation loop is the loop that make each &quot;frame&quot; happen, i.e. whatever happend
every 30 to 60 times (or, indeed, &quot;frames&quot;) per second - which is the following:
<em> the next frame is scheduled
</em> the current program (i.e. a draw() Function) is run
<em> the background is repainted if it has changed from the previous frame
</em> the new 3d scene is painted
* the stats widget on the top right is updated to show milliseconds taken by each loop
  frame.</p>
<p>Note that the followings are NOT done as part of the animation loop:
<em> Syntax checking of the program typed by the user (that&#39;s checked only when it changed)
</em> sound playing. That happens by its own series of timeouts (as defined by the
  optional &quot;bpm&quot; command) separately from the
  animation loop.
* blinking of the cursor</p>
<p>About the current Function being run:
note that this might not be the Function corresponding to the very latest
content of the editor, because of two reasons: the newest content of the editor
a) might just be syntactically incorrect or, b) even if it&#39;s syntactically correct
it might not be &quot;stable&quot; i.e. it might have thrown
a runtime error (for example used an undefined variable or function).</p>
<p>Rather, the current
draw() function is the latest program that is both syntactically correct and
&quot;stable&quot; (or in the process of being proven stable). Stability of a
program cannot be guaranteed, but LiveCodeLab heuristically considers as &quot;stable&quot; a
program once it&#39;s able to run for 5 frames without throwing errors. If the program
throws an error past this testing window, then LiveCodeLab currently has no
further fallback, so the Function will be just run each frame and hope is that
it has time to draw enough animation on the screen before it throws the error so that
some kind of animation will still be playing.
One could devise a mechanism by which a stack of stable functions is maintained, so
each failing function of the stack would cause the previous one to become the current
stable alternative. This would practically guarantee that there is a Function that
is simple enough in the past that it would contain no runtime errors - unless a
previous function has so dramatically borked the state of the entire system, but
that would probably take some malice.</p>
