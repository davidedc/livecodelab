Livecodelab Grunt Setup
=====================

#### Setup ####

To get setup with Grunt should be pretty easy.

 * Install Grunt globally ```npm install -g grunt```
 * use npm to get all the dependencies ```npm install```

#### Use ####

 * From your livecodelab directory run ```grunt compile``` . A fresh new indexMinified.html is baked for you,
 * ...or run ```grunt docs``` for new docs,
 * ...or run ```grunt clean``` to clean the build files.
