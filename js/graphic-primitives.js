// Fundamentals
// ============
// There are a couple of fundamentals of LiveCodeLab and a couple of
// complications of Three.js that shape the way
// graphic primitives work in this file.
//
// LiveCodeLab uses immediate mode graphics
// ----------------------
// First off, like Processing, LiveCodeLab shies away from "retained" graphics
// and instead uses "immediate mode" graphics.
// For context, "immediate mode" graphics means that when the user uses a graphic
// primitive, he is
// NOT given a handle that he can use to modify properties of that element at a
// later stage, contrarily to flash, DOM, CSS, openGL and Three.JS
// (to different degrees).
// Retained graphic modes keep structures in memory that make easy for example
// to do event handling (which object did I click?), hierarchy management
// (parent/child relationships, container/content, etc), property tweaking
// (change property X of object Y), and sometimes animation ( CoreAnimation from
// Apple for example), collision/overlap detection. Note that openGL is retained
// in that there are handles to geometry and textures, but little else is given
// (no events, no input, no physics/overlap/collision/animation).
// Also, retained graphics mode usually is smart about updating
// only minimal parts of the screen that need updating rather than redrawing the
// whole screen (again, openGL doesn't do that apart from basic frustum culling, but
// for example there is nothing to detect occlusions and avoid painting occluded
// objects).
// There are a few drawbacks in retained modes: a) programs that manage
// handles are more lengthy than programs that don't
// b) they are often not needed for example in
// 2d sprites-based videogames c) most importantly,
// they require deeper understanding of the underlying
// model (e.g. which property can I change? What are those called? How do I change
// parent/child relationship? How do events bubble up and where should I catch them?).
// Processing and LiveCodeLab go for immediate mode. Once the primitive is invoked, it
// becomes pixels and there is no built-in way to do input/event/hierarchies...
// Rather, there are a few properties that are set as a global state and apply to all
// objects. Examples are "fill" and "stroke".
//
// Relationship between objects, meshes, geometry, materials...
// ----------------------
// A Three.js object (or to be more precise, Object3D) can be a line or a mesh. A line
// is a line, a mesh can be anything else depending on what the geometry of the mesh
// is. There are more possible types such as particles, etc. but they are not currently
// used in LiveCodeLab. An object needs one more thing: a material.
//
// Caching of objects
// ----------------------
// Once created, objects are kept cached together with all possible materials that can be
// associated with it. Each object has to have its own set of materials because
// one can decide to draw one object in solid fill, one in normal color, one with
// an ambient light (i.e. lambert material), etc.
// 
// Objects are kept in the scene
// ----------------------
// Once an object is added to the scene, it's never removed. Rather, it's hidden if it's
// not used, but it's never removed. This is because adding/removing objects from the
// scene is rather expensive. Note that Mr Doob mentioned via email that subsequent
// versions of three.js have improved performance a lot, so it's worth trying another
// approach.
//
// Strokes are managed via separate objects for stroke and fill
// ----------------------
// There is a particular flag in Three.js materials for drawing wireframes. But materials
// cannot be combined, i.e. only one is associated at any time with a geometry. So one
// can either draw a wireframe or a fill. In previous versions of Three.js more than
// one material could be associated, but that has been deprecated, see
// https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/751 and instead a
// createMultiMaterialObject utility was put in place, which basically creates multiple
// objects one for each material, see
// https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/extras/SceneUtils.js#L29
// So the solution here is to create two disting objects.
// One for the fills and one, slightly "larger", for the strokes. In that way, the
// strokes are visible "in front" of the fills, and the fills cover the strokes "at
// the back"
//
// The order of materials matters
// ----------------------
// When an object is created, it must be first rendered with the most complex material,
// because internally in Three.js/WebGL memory is allocated only once. So a special
// mechanism is put in place by which new objects are drawn with the normalMaterial
// with scale 0, so they are rendered but they are invisible. In the next frame (i.e.
// after the first render) the correct material is used.
//
// "Spinning"
// ----------------------
// "Spinning" applies to all objects added to an empty frame: it makes all objects spin
// for a few frames. This has been implemented for two reasons a) cosmetic b) the user
// is likely to first use "box", and without spinning that would look like a boring
// square that appears without animation. Spinning gives many more cues: the environment
// is 3d, the lighting is special by default and all faces have primary colors, things
// animate. Without spinning, all those cues need to be further explained and demonstra
// ted.
