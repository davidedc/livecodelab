## Lexer is a variation/port of:
## 
## McLexer: A lexical analysis system/library for JavaScript.
## Author:  Matthew Might
## Site:    http://matt.might.net/
##          http://www.ucombinator.com/
## 
## The lexer associates rules with analysis states.
## 
## Each rule contains a regular expression to match, 
## and action to execute upon finding a match.
## 
## When a state matches its rules against an input text, 
## it chooses the rule with the longest match against the prefix 
## of the input text.
## 
## A lexical state is a collection of rules.
## 
## It has three primary methods:
## 
## + lex(input) runs a continuation-based lexer on the input;
##   lex invokes next once, and expects a continuation back;
##   it then invokes the continuation and expects each continuation
##   it invokes to return another continuation.  Once a continuation
##   returns null; parsing is complete.     
## 
## + findAndRunActionPairedToLongestAppliableRegex(input) runs a match against an input,
##   fires the action.
##   An action is a procedure that accepts the match data (an array),
##   the remainder of the input, and the current state and returns a function that
##   applies the rules again and finds and runs the next action. An action does not run
##   the next one (that would be recursion). Rather, it returns a function to find and
##   run the next one
## 
## Why this "step by step" approach instead of a normal recursion? The advantage is
## that you can stop the parsing and resume it any time you want. Suppose that
## you have a huge program to parse. With recursion, once you start you can't
## stop until the end (at least if you are using normal recursion as provided by
## the language runtime. If you implement your own recursion using your own stack
## then you could indeed pause/resume things). In a single-threaded language like
## Javascript this results in everything else "blocking". A "continuations" approach
## lets you stop and resume the parsing more easily, since you lex the program step
## by step in a manner that does not rely on the runtime stack. There is no recursion.
