###
## The animation loop takes care of drawing each "frame",
## ideally 30 to 60 times (or, indeed, "frames")
## per second. The following happens in each frame:
## * the next frame is scheduled
## * the current program (i.e. a draw() Function) is run
## * the draw() function changes the state of the system
##   e.g. changes the background, creates new scene graph
## * the background is repainted if it has changed from the previous frame
## * the new 3d scene is rendered via Three.js
## * the beat of the sound system is changed if needed
## * the "frame" counter is incremented
##
## Note that the followings are NOT done as part of the animation loop:
## * Syntax checking of the program typed by the user
##   (that's checked only when user changes via typing)
## * sound playing. That happens by its own series of timeouts
##   (as defined by the optional "bpm" command), separately from the
##   animation loop.
## * blinking of the cursor
##
## About the current Function being run:
## note that this might not be the Function corresponding to the very latest
## content of the editor, for two reasons:
## 1. the newest content of the editor might be syntactically incorrect
##    and hence can't be turned into a Function than can be run
## 2. even if syntactically correct, it might not be "stable"
##    i.e. it might have thrown a runtime error
##    (for example used an undefined variable or function),
##    in which case an older "stable" program is used.
##
## Rather, the current draw() function is the latest program
## that is both syntactically correct and "stable" (or in the process of
## being proven stable).
## Stability of a program cannot be guaranteed, but LiveCodeLab heuristically
## considers as "stable" a program once it's able to run for 5 frames
## without throwing runtime errors.
## If the program throws an error past this testing window, then LiveCodeLab
## currently has no further fallback, so the Function will be just run each
## frame and hope is that it has time to draw enough animation on the screen
## before it throws the error so that some kind of animation
## will still be playing.
## One could devise a mechanism by which a stack of stable functions
## is maintained, so each failing function of the stack would cause the
## previous one to become the current stable alternative.
## This would practically guarantee that there is a Function
## somewhere in the past that is simple enough that it would
## cause no runtime errors - unless a previous function has so
## dramatically borked the state of the entire system,
## but that would probably take some malice.
