###
## CodeCompiler makes available the user sketch
## (written in simplified syntax) as a runnable javascript function.
## Also note that CodeCompiler might return a program
## that substituted the program passed as input.
## This is because doOnce statements get transformed by pre-prending a
## tick once they are run, which prevents them from being run again.
## Note that CodeCompiler doesn't run the user sketch, it just
## makes it available to the ProgramRunner.
