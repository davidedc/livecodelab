###
## ProgramRunner manages the running function as it runs. E.g. this is not a
## translation step, this is managing things such as the actually running of the
## latest "stable" function and keeping track of when a function appears
## to be stable, and reinstating the last stable function if the current one
## throws a runtime error.
