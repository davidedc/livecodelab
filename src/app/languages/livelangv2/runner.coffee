###
## V2ProgramRunner manages interpretation of the AST. E.g. this is not a
## translation step, this is managing things such as the actually running of the
## latest "stable" program, keeping track of when a program appears
## to be stable, and reinstating the last stable program if the current one
## throws a runtime error.
