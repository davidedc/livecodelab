code: |
  // the Autocode button invents random
  // variations for you.

  // You can interrupt the Autocoder at
  // any time by pressing the button again,
  // or you can press CTRL-Z
  // (or CMD-Z on Macs) to undo (or re-do) some of
  // the steps even WHILE the autocoder is running,
  // if you see that things got
  // boring down a particular path of changes.
