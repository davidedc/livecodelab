  # runtime and compile-time error management //////////
  #/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  # Two different types of errors are managed in
  # two slightly different ways.
  #
  # Compile-time errors are the errors such as an extra
  # comma being added, or an unbalanced parenthesis, or
  # in general any of the syntactic problems.
  # These errors are just reported and the
  # new borked program does *not* result in a new
  # draw Function, so the previous syntactically correct
  # program is kept as the draw Function. The editor
  # content is kept the same as the user is probably just
  # finishing to type something.
  # If the autocoder is active, the editor
  # undoes the change, which triggers in a recompilation.
  # So this undo/recompilation cycle results in eventually
  # a syntactically correct program being set as
  # the draw Function.
  #
  # Runtime errors are things such as calling a function
  # with invalid parameters, accessing a non-existing
  # field of an object, accessing a null or an undefined,
  # accessing a variable that is not defined anywhere.
  # Runtime errors cannot be caught at compile time (not in
  # general anyways) because they are syntactically correct
  # and doing analysis on runtime behaviour at compile time
  # is extremely difficult if not outright impossible.
  # For example one might want to try to figure out whether
  # all the called functions and all the referenced variables
  # actually exist. In practice though one might create
  # those variables at runtime depending on complex tests
  # on state of the system, so one cannot really figure out
  # at compile time whether all functions and variables will
  # actually be in place when the program runs. One could
  # carry out some clever checks in particular cases, but *in
  # general* it's an impossible thing to do.
  # So an "unstable" program might often pass the compile checks
  # and be turned into a new draw Function.
  # When the next frame runs (or at some point in one of the
  # next frames), the draw Function is run and
  # a runtime error is thrown. At this point what we just
  # want to do is to keep the editor contents the same (because
  # user might be just finishing to type something) and we
  # just swap the current draw Function with a previous draw
  # Function that seemed to be stable, so that the animation
  # in the background doesn't stop. Note again that there is no
  # guarantee that just because a function was stable in the
  # past that it might still be stable now. For example the old
  # stable function might do silly things in the new state
  # that has been changed/borked in the meantime.
  # Or just simply a stable Function might
  # eventually do some silly things on its own, for example
  # it might do an out-of bounds array reference as the frame
  # count is incremented. Since at the moment we keep
  # track of only one stable function at a time (rather than
  # a stack of the) in general one cannot guarantee
  # that the animation will keep going no matter what. It probably
  # will in most normal cases though.
  # When the autocoder is active, a runtime error *does not* swap
  # the current function for an old stable one. Doing so
  # causes some bad interactions with the undoing of the
  # editor. Rather, the editor "undoes" its content,
  # which causes old content to be recompiled, and this
  # undo/recompile cycle carries on until a
  # syntactically-correct version of the program can be
  # established as the draw Function. If this new version still
  # throws a runtime error, the editor "undoes" again, until a
  # program that is both syntactically correct and stable
  # is found.
